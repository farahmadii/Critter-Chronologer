# A Software as a Service app for veterinarian
This enterprise project developed in Spring boot allows users to create schedules that
associate pets, owners, and employees with calendar events.
I used both JDBC and Hibernate to persist data in an external database.
CRUD operations are exposed via a REST controller layer.
Finally I've integration tested the app with SpringBootTest. Usual API calls can also be done using provided json file in Postman.
